Generic Links App

The links app allows generic links between any models. You need to add a setting similar to this:

To register specific models that they can be links, a link_schema.py module needs to be created in
your app. The registry system is comparable with how django.contrib.admin works.
Every linkable needs a certain list of attributes. Either defined on the model itself or provided with a wrapper.
A list of the needed attributes is in `links.schema_registry.ATTRIBUTES`. Be aware that 'title' and 'description'
are also used in the autocomplete widget.

There a multiple ways how you can define a link/wrapper:

`from links import schema
from news_and_events import models
from news_and_events import admin`

1. Very simple case. Your model has all the needed attributes already

`schema.register(models.Event, search_fields=admin.EventAdmin.search_fields)`


2. The attributes on the model are named different:

`schema.register(models.Event, search_fields=admin.EventADmin.search_fields,
	title='name', description='some_foreign_key.title', heading='"Event"')`

Each named argument after search_fields represents a attribute the wrapper will have.
A string means the dot noted path will be used to traverse through object, starting from
the linked object. `description='some_foreign_key.title'` will result in using
`theobj.some_foreign_key.title` for the title. It does not matter if the attributes are properties
or callable methods, both work.

`heading='"Event"'` will use a static string for the heading. Both `"'foo'"` and `'"bar"'` work.

3. You want to do some extra calculation.

This works by providing a callable that takes one argument: the linked object
It can be a lamda function or a external function

`def some_very_complicated_function(obj):
	r = []
	for x in obj.something.all():
		if x.y:
			r.append(u"foo: %s" % x.bar)
		else:
			r.append(u"stuff: %s" % x.bar)
	return "<br />".join(r)
schema.register(models.Event, search_fields=admin.EventAdmin.search_fields,
	title=lambda obj: u"%s (%s)" % (unicode(obj), obj.active_count),
	description=some_very_complicated_function)`


4. You have a quite complex wrapper: make your own Wrapper subclass

`from links import LinkWrapper
class MyEventLinkWrapper(LinkWrapper):
	search_fields = admin.EventAdmin.search_fields
	def title(self):
		return self.obj.something(extra=' asdfsadf')
	def description(self):
		return "static description"
schema.register_wrapper(Event, MyEventLinkWrapper)`
