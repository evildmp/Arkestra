*********************************
Using the bundled example project
*********************************

Arkestra comes with a bundled example project - in the `example` folder - which
is ready to go, complete with database and media files.

Once you have the example project running, have a look at the site.

The admin interface is at `/admin`; username and password are both `arkestra`.

Once logged in to the admin, set your `Site` appropriately -
`/admin/sites/site/`.

************************
Running your own project
************************

The `example` project in Arkestra contains a ready-made `settings.py` file, not
to mention the `urls.py` and so on that you'll need.

Either copy these, or if you know what you're doing, copy the relevant parts to
the files in your own project.

Start with the Python runserver, and get that going.

In order to make anything work, you'll need to do log in to Admin (username and
password are both `arkestra`) and do three things.

* create a Page
* create an Entity
* link the Entity to the Page, by selecting the Page as the Entity's /Home page/

And since Arkestra needs to know what the *base entity* of your site is, in
your ``arkestra_settings`` file add something like::

ARKESTRA_BASE_ENTITY = 1

where the value corresponds to the id of your base entity.

In production
*************

Run `collectstatic` -
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles for media files
to get them into the right place.

For deployment, point your web hosting platform not at `settings.py`, but
`deployment_settings.py`, which turns off various debug modes.
